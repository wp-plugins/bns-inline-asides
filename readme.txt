This plugin will allow you to style sections of the post, or page, content with added emphasis by leveraging a style element from the active theme.

== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to add a personal comment into the body of a post or page and have it stand out from the rest of the content?
Have you really wanted to throw a rant in a review because the subject just really got under your skin but you don't want to dramatically disrupt the content?
This plugin will allow you to style sections of the post, or page, content with a shortcode that can add more emphasis by leveraging a style element from the active theme.
These asides can be left open as part of the content flow; or these asides can be closed to leave your readers the option of opening them if they choose to.

= Usage =
This plugin makes use of WordPress Shortcode API (additional information can be found in the codex here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)

The basic shortcode usage is `[aside]CONTENT[/aside]`. The default values of the shortcode are type: aside; and, status: open.

* `[aside]CONTENT[/aside] = [aside type="aside" status="open"]CONTENT[/aside]`

To use the `[aside]` shortcode and have it initially "closed" any status other than "open" will work as the plugin will change the status to "closed" if it is not equal to "open".

The pre-defined aside types currently included:

* Note - uses the theme element's default text color on a Light Grey background
* Rant - uses black text on a red background with a non-repeating flame graphic
* Changelog - sets the font to monospace, reminiscent of type written notes
* Footnote - uses lower-case roman numerals when the items are written using an (HTML) ordered list
* Nota Bene (NB) - italicizes the text within the aside

See the frequently asked questions section for how to add your own custom type.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the "Rant" type work with the "H" tags? =
Not all possible combinations of existing BNS Inline Aside types have been set as defaults.
Please feel free to add the bns-inline-asides-custom-stylesheet.css option and create your own combinations ...
... and let us know about them. We would be very happy to consider adding them as defaults.

= How can I style the plugin output? =
To add your own custom aside type styles you might consider creating a new stylesheet in this plugin's folder using the name: bnsia-custom-types.css

The plugin will create a class name from the custom aside type you use in your shortcode. For example, `[aside type="bacon"]` will generate these classes you can style:

* .open-aside.bacon
* .close-aside.bacon
* .bnsia.aside.bacon
* blockquote.aside.bacon

This method can also be used to over-write the Pre-Defined Aside Types styles as the bnsia-custom-types.css file loads after the main stylesheet.

The bnsia-custom-types.css stylesheet should not be over-written by updates.

= How do I use the 'show' and 'hide' parameters? =
If you do not want to use the default 'show' and 'hide' parameters, you can change them to your own preference in each instance of the shortcode. If you want your aside type to be dynamically inserted into the message simply use the `%s` placeholder in your custom message.

Here are some examples:

* `[aside type="bacon" show="Want to see my <em>%s</em>?" status="closed"]`
* `[aside type="soup" hide="No %s for you!"]`
